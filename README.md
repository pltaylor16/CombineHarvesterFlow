# CombineHarvesterFlow

## Pip installation instructions

To install CombineHarvesterFlow run:

    pip install CombineHarvesterFlow

There are issues with pip-installed versions of jax on some machines. If this is an issue, you can also follow the alternative install instructions below.

## Alternative installation instructions

CombineHarvesterFlow uses [jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [flowjax](https://github.com/danielward27/flowjax). The following installation instructions will automatically install both CombineHarvesterFlow and all required packages:

    conda create -n jax python==3.10
    conda activate jax

Follow the jax install instructions [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for CPU or GPU depending on your local hardware. These instructions can fail on some machines in which case we recommend the conda-forge installation:
    
    conda install -c conda-forge jaxlib
    conda install -c conda-forge jax
 
Once jax is installed run: 

    git clone https://github.com/pltaylor16/CombineHarvesterFlow.git
    cd CombineHarvesterFlow
    pip install .

Training of the normalizing flows can be slower when using CPUs (this is not normally problematic in low-dimensions e.g. n<7). Therefore we recommend using GPUs, if possible.

## Perlmutter (NERSC) installation instructions

The process for installing CombineHarvesterFlow at NERSC with access to GPUs is slightly more involved. First, we need to install jax following the [NERSC documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/using-python-perlmutter/#jax):

    module load cudatoolkit/12.2
    module load cudnn/8.9.3_cuda12
    module load python
    # Create a new conda environment
    conda create -n jax python=3.10 pip numpy scipy
    # Activate the environment before using pip to install JAX
    conda activate jax
    # Install a compatible wheel
    pip install --no-cache-dir "jax==0.4.23" "jaxlib[cuda12_cudnn89]==0.4.23" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

See the [NERSC documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/using-python-perlmutter/#jax) for more details on how to find a working version of jax. After that, install CombineHarvesterFlow:
    
    git clone https://github.com/pltaylor16/CombineHarvesterFlow.git
    cd CombineHarvesterFlow
    pip install .

If you want to run CombineHarvesterFlow in a notebook, you will need to set up a helper script that automatically loads the Cuda modules. Detailed instructions for this can be found [here](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/jupyter/how-to-guides/#how-to-customize-a-kernel-with-a-helper-shell-script) and are summarized below. First setup the Jupyter kernel:

    pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name jax --display-name Jax

Then create a helper script for the jupyter kernel:

    touch $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/jax/kernel-helper.sh

After that, add the following lines to that new script:

    #!/bin/bash
    module load cudatoolkit/12.2
    module load cudnn/8.9.3_cuda12
    module load python
    conda activate jax
    exec "$@"

and make the script executable:

    chmod u+x $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/jax/kernel-helper.sh

Finally, modify the kernel json file here: `$HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/jax/kernel.json`, to automatically run the helper script when starting the kernel (if opening the file from the JupyterHub interface, right-click on it and select Open With -> Editor). The file should look something like this (where the `"{resource_dir}/kernel-helper.sh"` line is new):

    {
     "argv": [
      "{resource_dir}/kernel-helper.sh",
      "python",
      "-m",
      "ipykernel_launcher",
      "-f",
      "{connection_file}"
     ],
     "display_name": "Jax",
     "language": "python",
     "metadata": {
      "debugger": true
     }
    }

For detailed instructions, see the [NERSC jax documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/using-python-perlmutter/#jax) and the [NERSC kernel customization documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/jupyter/how-to-guides/#how-to-customize-a-kernel-with-a-helper-shell-script).
